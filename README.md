## RedLof Cleaner\-AntiVirus


</div>

### Description

This software eradicates RedLof Virus from infected files, I developed this util. for my students as the Antivirus we got in our institution was not able to clean the files saying its quite polymorphic. it rather asks to delete them which was causing loss of important files of student projects
 
### More Info
 
No special input just a click needed to start the program

The software searches for the signature of the virus and removes it from the file.

It tries for all possible polymorphic combinations of the Virus

This also makes it work slow but effective.

A List of cleaned files and a Log File is Displayed at the end of cleaning

It may ask you to delete your kernel, doing so by now hasnt accrued with any effects. infact keeping it is not an option coz only virus code is there in the file no more kernel code exists there.

While cleaning VBS files it may not patch the whole virus code some pieces may remain in the code but be not worry the virus code will be handicapped and wont work at all. Bcoz of this the software may show the files as infected even after cleaning but they are not harmful any more
